# CS50 Project
## FINANCE
FINANCE is a website which for stock exchange purpose. we can buy as well sell stocks here(ofcourse! not for real).
I learnt flask from [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).
technologies used for creating this website are flask, html, css and javascript.
makesure you install requirements before you try to <flask run> also check whether API is working or not, if not read documentation [IEX](https://iexcloud.io/).
